The purpose of this proposal is to conduct research to help board members understand both the feasibility and the benefit of including CS361 as a required course. The information for research will be gathered from professional sources, professors and students. The goal of the research is to ensure that Grand Valley stays up to date preparing students for the changing field of technology.
Computer Science is unique from other programs because technology expands and adapts more rapidly than any other field. Ideally, the curriculum would cover all of the new themes that emerge in technology, however, it is not feasible to expand the curriculum proportionately to the expansion of technology. Instead, the curriculum aims to teach the essential topics to familiarize students with the basic elements applicable to most technology. 
The current course requirements for Grand Valley students seeking a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science appears to inadequately familiarizes students with one of these essential topics, operating systems concepts. As a result, students struggle to excel in CS452: Operating Systems and Concepts. CS361: System Programming provides students with familiarity of operating system concepts the preparation necessary to thrive in CS452. The addition of CS361 to the required course ordering could solidify the reputation of a Computer Science degree from Grand Valley and produce students that are better prepared for the work environment.
There exists an abundance of research conducted by ACM and IEEE, two of the world’s largest educational and scientific computing societies. The research aids colleges in deciding upon curricula. The first step is to review the information presented by the “Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science” and compare Grand Valley’s curriculum to these national guidelines.
The next step is to interview professors. Professors provide a more personal understanding of student development. In addition, they understand the mission of the college as whole. Researchers will interview professors to understand their opinions on adding CS361 to the required course ordering. Next, researchers will create surveys to be distributed in classes. The surveys should aim to understand students experience in the Operating Systems and Concepts course. Students also can describe how they feel about the current course load for Computer Science majors.
The final step is to evaluate the data gathered by the research. The data will be evaluated and appropriate course of action will be determined. The research will be summarized into a report to be presented to CIS board members
The scope of the proposal is limited to researching the issue. The proposal postpones the process of adjusting the curriculum. The intention of this proposal is to present the cost/benefit analysis to relevant board members capable of making the advised change. Board members will use this information to ensure the curriculum stays current with the changing technology. The program will require 5 researchers working 244 hours at $10/hour. The research will require approximate 1.5 months to complete.
Conducting the proposed research will instill faith in all Computer Science students. Students will see that their college works to stay up to date on the rapidly changing field of technology. In addition, the research will help board member to ensure that the Computer Science program maintains its ACM accreditation and a respectable reputation.
